# Legacy-MCDzienny-Commands
Legacy commands for Minecraft Classic MCDzienny servers

These commands are intended to be used for MCDzienny servers. To use these commands, generate a clean build of MCDzienny, copy these commands into the extra\commands\source folder. Once copied, start your server and run the command /compile <command_name_here>. If your command compiles successfully, run /cmdload <command_name_here>. Once executed, the command is now live on your server! If you'd like these commands to automatically load per server-boot, enter the command name into cmdautoload.txt in the text directory.
